# Text-Sentiment-Analyzer
Text-Sentiment-Analyzer is a project based on Natural Language Processing to understand the opinion/bias of customers using customer feedback from different sources. The feedback data is collected using Web Scraping &amp; Regex. I have used Hugging Face Transformers and BERT to be able to calculate sentiments of the feedbacks received.
